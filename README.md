# How to Run the Program
First, make sure you have Flask installed using `pip install flask`.

Then, simply open your favorite IDE (we love PyCharm!) and run the website by running `app.py`. The terminal should output a link to the website that you can navigate to. For us, it's usually 127.0.0.1, but it may be different for you.

## Tools Used
For our project, we used HTML, Bootstrap CSS, and JavaScript running on a Flask server.
